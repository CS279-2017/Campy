##To Run
Make sure an instance of mongodb is running. You may need to update app/server/config.js to reach the correct endpoint.
```
cd app
npm start
```
go to 
```
localhost:8080
```
Note: One of the MERN caveats is FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content). This is due to hotswapping during dev, however shouldn't be a problem for PROD.
